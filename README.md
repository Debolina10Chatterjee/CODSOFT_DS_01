# Titanic Survival Prediction

## 🚢 Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict whether a passenger aboard the Titanic survived or not. The dataset used for this project contains information about individual passengers, including their age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and survival status.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used for this project is commonly referred to as the Titanic dataset. It can be obtained from various sources, including the Kaggle website. The dataset typically consists of the following columns:

1. **PassengerId**: Unique identifier for each passenger
2. **Survived**: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
3. **Pclass**: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
4. **Name**: Passenger's name
5. **Sex**: Passenger's gender
6. **Age**: Passenger's age
7. **SibSp**: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic
8. **Parch**: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic
9. **Ticket**: Ticket number
10. **Fare**: Passenger fare
11. **Cabin**: Cabin number
12. **Embarked**: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

## 🛠️ Requirements
To run the code for this project, you will need the following Python libraries:
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn



## 📝 Usage & Settings 

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Before building the model, it's essential to preprocess the data. This involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling if necessary.
2. **Model Building**: Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forests) and train the model using the preprocessed data.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the trained model using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
4. **Prediction**: Once the model is trained and evaluated, you can use it to make predictions on new data.
